# Sign Language Recognition

üöÄ **Sign Language Recognition** is a real-time application that converts speech to text and provides visual feedback through videos and images. It allows users to communicate using sign language by recognizing spoken words and displaying corresponding signs.

## Features

üéâ **Key Features**:

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text in real-time.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual feedback through videos and images based on the recognized speech.
- **Dynamic Content**: Displays random videos from the video directory or alphabet images based on the recognized phrase.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the application through a web interface.

üî• **Upcoming Features**:

- **Improved Noise Handling**: Implement better noise cancellation techniques to enhance speech recognition in noisy environments.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Add support for recognizing gestures in addition to speech recognition.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize the visual feedback and adjust settings according to their preferences.

## Installation
